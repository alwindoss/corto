Short URL service

Started writing this service as a way to learn how short url services work.
Though not a perfect service, it still works!

### Things that are possible today
* Create a short URL
* Delete a short URL
* Go to the short URL(Ex: this service is hosted at http://localhost:8080/ after short url is created if you go to short URL with http://localhost:8080/g1GqqrMDM then it would redirect to the Original URL

### To Do
* Build a UI to create and list the short URLs
* Integrate with Github, Google for authentication
* Dashbord showing analytics of the Short URLs
